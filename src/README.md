# src
This is my first rust project lol
## cli
This file contains code relating to user input.

It is responsible for declaring how the user will interact with the tool, getting input 
from the user and returning it in a way which is nice to use for my other functions.

## client
This file (not yet) contains code relating to doing http requests and submitting code etc.

I have no idea how i'm gonna do this yet.

## config
This file (kinda) contains code relating to configuration.

The functions here actually _do_ the configuring and the read and writing of files etc.

## commands
This folder (todo) contains code relating to running commands.

The functions here actually _do_ the commands.

## main.rs
The entry point.
